## Dramatic components:

### 1. Challenge:

• What skills will be required to play our game?

- Curiosity, memory, using the keyboard for the progress of the "trip" in the case, quick response according to the tasks the player will receive, punctuality, competitiveness.
  
• Suppose we want to allow the player to manually choose, at the beginning of the game, between three different difficulty levels. What exactly will change in our game between levels? (What objects/characteristics will change?)

- In our game, the Parsha of the week, the player experiences, travels and feels the Parsha and performs tasks according to the development of the Parsha and accumulates points according to the performance of his tasks. There are no clear stages in our game and each game = a case and will be opened every week according to the case. We will make sure that the tasks will increase in difficulty each time according to the new characters or the new situation that will be discovered according to the case.

• Suppose we want to change the difficulty level dynamically according to the player's progress. How will our game detect the skill level of the player and adjust the difficulty level accordingly?

- The level of difficulty increases according to the progress of the plot, i.e. according to the progress of the player in the plot and it is predetermined, which means that the level of difficulty does not change according to the skill level of the player.

### 2. Flow:

• How will you focus the player's attention on the game and avoid distractions?

- At the bottom of the game monitor is written words - statements between characters, explanation of tasks, results, new areas the player has reached.
  
• How will you give the player a feeling that he controls the game and that his actions have an impact?

- Give the player a free hand in his walk in the game. In the end he will be able to progress according to the plot properly or progress and skip places/quests but in the end his score will suffer from this. The player will receive feedback if he continues according to the plot and will therefore be careful to receive positive feedback and know that his actions affect the continuation of the plot. Because if he deviates from the path, he will not finish the case with the correct items/route.
  
• How will you give the player feedback on success or failure?

- When the player succeeds in a task, he will receive a positive feedback of congratulations! or any other feedback. When the player fails the task, he will receive reinforcing feedback and encourage him to try again!
 
### 3. Entertainment:
  
• How will the game allow the player to do nice things that are not directly related to the goal of the game?

- When moving to a new scene, there will be additional ways to accumulate points such as: a board will open with a number of individual letters and a timer of 30 seconds in which the player will have to form a word related to the case from the given letters or a short memory game where he will be asked about something that has happened so far in the plot and you will test his photographic memory. These are amusements that are not directly related to the game but add interest, challenges and another way to accumulate points in an educational way without the player noticing it.
  
• What types of players (from the types we studied in class, or other types) should the game be suitable for?

-The types of players the game should fit:

-The competitive-plays to be better than others i.e. to finish the plot before his friends and gain the most points.
  
-The Explorer- Curious to discover the world of that affair, to meet the characters, looking for adventure.
  
-The achiever- like the competitive play to advance to increasing levels of achievement.

-Clown- The game is also suitable for players who don't take the game seriously and just progress through the plot without gaining points, completing tasks but the goal will still be achieved because they will still experience the affair even if they didn't care about the game in the first place.

• What can you do to make the game suitable for other types of players?

- We can invest in a high level design and then the artist will be another type of player that the game can adapt to.
  
-Perhaps the player will be given the ability to randomly choose the entrance to the following scenes without him himself even knowing where he is entering and thus the type of player who tells stories - who likes to live in fantasy and imagination / create, will also be adapted to the game.
  
### 4. Emotions:
 
• What emotions do you expect the player to feel while playing?

- We expect that each game will flood the player with different emotions because each plot is different from chapter to chapter. Some describe scary, challenging scenes, some are logical and legitimate, some fill the air with joy or admiration, or true joy and happiness. We expect each game to fill the player with the feeling we had when we read the story.
  
• How will your game design contribute to creating these feelings?

- The design of the game can speed up the player's experience and "throw" him straight into that period, which reinforces the vivid feeling of the player as if he himself lived in that spoken period.
  
### 5.Backstory:
  
• What is the plot background of the game - what happened before the game started?

- The plot background of the game is a reminder of the end of the previous episode if it is an episode in the sequels. Or opening the same case if it starts a new story. And then at a certain point the game integrates with the plot and continues to travel and experience the sequel.
  
• How will you convey this background story to the player?

- As said above, there will be a place at the bottom of the game screen where things will be written and the player will have to follow.
  
### 6. Characters: Who will be the characters in the game?
  
• Main characters - who will be the "hero" and who will be the main "antagonist"?

- In each episode the characters change in each episode there is a different hero and it is always the actor. For example, in the book of Genesis 4 the last episodes describe the story of Joseph and his brothers and Joseph is our hero, as the role of the antagonist changes from time to time at first it is his brothers, then it is Pharaoh.
  
• Secondary characters - who will they be, and what will each one add to the player's experience?

- The secondary characters also change from episode to episode, they add to the player's experience - the feeling that they are really in the world of the Bible, they may be aiming for the rest of the way. For Doge - in the episode I mentioned above, the brothers are the secondary characters and they actually caused this whole story to unfold by being jealous of all This is the case with Yosef and they tried to get rid of him and here there is a whole world to tell and learn from him.
  
• How will the characters change during the game?

- They will change according to the case, in appearance, in their age and in their actions.
  
• Will the characters behave in a way reminiscent of "free will"?

- If there is a character who behaves like this yes, but mostly no.
